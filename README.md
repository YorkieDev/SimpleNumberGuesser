# Number Guessing Game

## Description

This is a simple number-guessing game written in Python. The program generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the user has to guess the number to win.
I created it to familiarize myself with While Loops and elif/if else statements. 

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the Python file.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the Python file.
2. Run the following command:

```
python numberguesser.py
```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to guess the number.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive.
- Handles invalid input.
- Provides hints if the guess is too high or too low.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature branch. Pull requests are welcome.
It would be cool to see someone build a gui in tkinter or pygame for this.
